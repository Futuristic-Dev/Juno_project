# Asah Space Website Repository
To build this project, we use npm to manage the packages. To get it running, run:
`npm install`
<br/>
This will install all the packages needed from the [package.json](https://github.com/Von-sledge/Juno_project/blob/main/package.json)
<br/>
The [scripts](https://github.com/Von-sledge/Juno_project/blob/main/scripts) folder contains all the javascript files which are sectioned into subfolders representing what they do. All the files are imported into the [App.js](https://github.com/Von-sledge/Juno_project/blob/main/scripts/App.js) file for rendering.
<br/>
<br/>
Also, [styles](https://github.com/Von-sledge/Juno_project/blob/main/styles) constains all the subfolders responsible for handling the styles on the page. All subfiles under the folders are imported into the [main.scss](https://github.com/Von-sledge/Juno_project/blob/main/styles/main.scss) file and rendered on the site.
<br/>
<br/>
The [app.html](https://github.com/Von-sledge/Juno_project/blob/main/app.html) is the main html file always rendered when there is something or a change in any part of the website.


## NB:
There are a lot of features to be added as time goes on. However, please try very hard not to break the previous existing code and also try to always check for remote changes before making any changes.
